## Customer Retention System based on Visiting History

###	Project Description
It is obvious that retail stores and business owners are willing to absorb more customers. This goal is partially followed through marketing campaigns and promotions. However, their budget for marketing is limited as well. Hence, it is important to first identify those targets that are more valuable to be marketed and then find the appropriate type of promotional offer for targeted marketing.

As a potential problem to be addressed, there is lack of a novel method or intelligent system to identify various types of (potential) customers based on their likelihood of revisiting and hence purchasing from stores repeatedly. Such identification of visitors/customers provides business owners with more effective as well as affordable targeted marketing.

### Project objectives
*	Categorizes visitors/customers of the mall based on the visiting history
*	Makes predictions on visiting likelihood of visitors
*	Makes decision for target selection in targeted marketing
*	Captures shopping interests of visitors
*	Makes recommendations for efficient targeted marketing

###	Project scope
Analyze WiFi access history data of each customer and get a conclusion whether this person would visit the mall again. Send offer via e-mail to the potentially non-returning customers in order to attract them back.
